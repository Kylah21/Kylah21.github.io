      <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merfolk">Merfolk</a> population is rapidly declining due to Global warming upsetting the balance of the ocean's eco-systems! Our organization, Save the Merfolk (STM), strives to not only provide emergency assistance to stranded and injured merfolk but raise awareness to maintain and help the current merpeople population recover. </p>

      <p> The site of our facility is on Fernandina Island of the Galapagos Islands.  STM is fast approaching our grand opening of our new Rehabilitation Center that not only will provide a headquarters for our rescue efforts but will provide housing for our injured Merfolk and a state-of-the-art birthing center. </p>
