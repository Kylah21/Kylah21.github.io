      <p> Our organization, Save the Merfolk (STM), located in the Galapagos Islands is dedicated to assisting merfolk in distress. Our team consists of 15 brave and  dedicated individuals who put their lives on the line multiple times a month on our Search and Rescue Missions. Merfolk, due to the rising ocean temperatures, often become disoriented, are injured by watercraft and fishing nets, or can have birthing issues due to warmer water temperatures. With caring and aware people like you donating we can work at our highest capacity. Our facility will soon feature a state-of-the-art birthing center on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernandina_Island">Fernandina Island!</a>
